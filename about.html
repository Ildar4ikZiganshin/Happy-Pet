      <h2 class="section-subtitle">We are team of dreamers</h2>

      <p class="text-content">Happy Pet was founded in 2005 in a small town just outside of Madison, Wisconsin by husband and wife team Jake and Emily Peterson. The Petersons had always loved animals, owning several rescue dogs and cats over the years. After Emily took a career break from her corporate job to raise their young children, she started volunteering at the local animal shelter. She was disheartened to see so many wonderful pets having trouble finding forever homes.</p>
      <p class="text-content">At the same time, Jake's job required frequent travel, and they struggled to find boarding facilities they fully trusted to care for their beloved pets. They realized there was a need in their community for a business that could be an adoption hub for homeless animals while also providing excellent pet boarding services.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="text-content">Over the next 15 years, Happy Pet expanded twice - doubling their boarding space and adding innovative playrooms, agility courses, and other enrichment areas for guests. They also hired animal trainers and veterinary technicians to provide top-notch care and training services.</p>
      <p class="text-content">Despite their growth, the Petersons stayed true to their original mission of finding furever homes for as many unwanted pets as possible. Every year, hundreds of homeless dogs, cats, bunnies and more find their new families through Happy Pet's adoption center. With its unique dual business model, Happy Pet has made the community a happier, more pet-friendly place.</p>
      <p class="text-content">What started as one couple's dream has now become an award-winning pet care facility that has adopted out over 15,000 rescue animals since opening. Happy Pet's legacy is improving the lives of pets and people across the region.</p>

      <p class="text-content">With their life savings and a small business loan, the Petersons took a leap of faith and opened Happy Pet in a renovated former dairy farm. The spacious facility included separate areas for boarding dogs, cats, and other small pets like rabbits and guinea pigs. But it also had a bright adoption center up front where rescue pets could be showcased for potential new families.</p>
      <p class="text-content">Happy Pet started small, working only with the local humane society. But word quickly spread about their compassionate staff, immaculate boarding facilities, and the lovable pets available for adoption. Within a couple years, they grew to partner with over a dozen animal rescues across the region.</p>
